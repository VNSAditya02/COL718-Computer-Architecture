The assignment is to implement different memory models: SC, TSO (just relax the write--> read memory order), and
weak consistency (no memory orders other than fences) and compare their performance.

You will need to look at some of the recent changes to the Tejas causality tool to understand how to make these
changes. Please start writing the code to implement these models. You need to submit a report. There will also be a
demo and code walkthrough.
